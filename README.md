# Lottery Contracts

## About

This project is to create a smart contract lottery.

## What we want it to do?

1. Users can enter by paying for a ticket
2. After X period of time, the lottery will automatically draw a winner
    1. This will be done programatically
3. Using Chainlink VRF & Chainlink Automation
    1. Chainlink VRF -> Randomness
    2. Chainlink Automation -> Time based trigger
